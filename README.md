This study aims to show how and to what extent Turkey has been affected socio-economically after the first COVID19 case that emerged in Turkey on March 11, 2020. I have done so far through Google Scholar for my research. I could not find many sources specifically on this topic, but there are many data that including the effect of COVID19 on Turkeyâ€™s socio-economic. I plan to use the following tool in this research:

## Abstract
Pandemics leave significant marks on the memories of societies with their permanent impacts. Going beyond a cause of disease or death, they can have consequences in many aspects, psychological, social and economic ones being in the first place. The Covid-19 outbreak, which first emerged in China and has spread to the whole world as of the first months of 2020, has the potential to constitute a breaking the course of history, as well. Turkey is located on the transit point between Asia and Europe with its geographical position, and thus, received its share from the outbreak of Covid-19, which spreads through social contact. The first official case was recorded on 11 March 2020, and then the virus spread rapidly. 

###Introduction
With the spread of the virus, people start to socialize less and avoid excessive consumption except for their basic needs during quarantine processes. This significant decrease in consumption has a negative impact on the economy. Employers are following some methods to be less affected by the damages caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. For example; They follow a policy of shrinking their companies, some of them give unpaid leave to their employees, and some of them are in a position to close their workplaces completely. This situation brings along unemployment and unemployment brings poverty with it. Thus, the level of unemployment and poverty in our country is increasing even more.

##In this project:
I used data from some research on Google Scholar. I must admit that I had difficulty in finding data during this research. Although the data seem to be in the foreground today, I realized that they are not that much. Raw data is hard to come by, as others find and publish the data they find through their own filters. I also noticed that it requires a lot of attention when evaluating it myself.
When starting a project/research, it is necessary to create a dictionary of its own regarding the subject. Thus, the searched result is found more specifically.
On the other hand, the impact of the pandemic process on the country was discussed many times, but the data of the socio part were not clear enough. This is because having abstract data is not as easy as having concrete data.

However, I tried to bring together the data I could find as best I could. For this, I used the following resources:

In addition, I tried to use https://app.datawrapper.de/ tool for data visualization.
